# Entertainment and Sports Recreational Fantasy (ESRF)

_For a live version of ESRF, click here: [ESRF](https://esrf.herokuapp.com/)._

ESRF is an ESPN Fantasy Basketball clone that allows users fully customaize the fantasy basketball experience. Users can make fantasy leagues for recreational leagues, tournaments, pick-up games, and more. They can track their stats and compete against one another. This adds another layer of fun to both the players and spectators.
